# dotfiles from David Cintron (david@davidcintron.com)

I've set my dotfiles up from what I learned from the Advanced Command Line Peepcode Screencast (defunct)

I think it's a pretty great way of setting it up.
All you have to do is source your .bashrc in ~/ and it loads up the dotfiles in your user folder
ie my ~/.bashrc only has . ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc (in OS X you need to source it in .bash_profile AFAIK)
