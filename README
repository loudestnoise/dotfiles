dotfiles from David Cintron (david@loudestnoise.com)
I've set my dotfiles up from what I learned from the Advanced Command Line Peepcode Screencast
http://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line
I think it's a pretty great way of setting it up.
All you have to do is source your .bashrc in ~/ and it loads up the dotfiles in your user folder
ie my ~/.bashrc only has . ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc
